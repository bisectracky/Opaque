# FASTQ-iT
The concept of applying Merkle Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for the cryptographic integrity verification of large-scale genomic data like FASTQ and BAM files is an emerging area, often discussed in the context of blockchain and decentralized storage solutions for sensitive data. The use of Merkle structures and barcoding offers potential advantages over traditional checksum methods like MD5 or SHA-256 in managing the dynamic and large nature of these files.
